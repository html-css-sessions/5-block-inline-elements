# 5-block-inline-elements

* HTML is made up of various elements that act as the building blocks of web pages.

* For the purpose of styling, elements are divided into two categories: block-level elements and inline elements.

* Every HTML element has a **default display value** depending on what type of element it is. 

* The default display value for most elements is **block** or **inline**.



## BLOCK-LEVEL ELEMENTS

* A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

* The **div** element is a block-level element.
