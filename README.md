# 5-block-inline-elements

* HTML is made up of various elements that act as the building blocks of web pages.

* For the purpose of styling, elements are divided into two categories: block-level elements and inline elements.

* Every HTML element has a **default display value** depending on what type of element it is. 

* The default display value for most elements is **block** or **inline**.



## BLOCK-LEVEL ELEMENTS

* A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

* The **div** element is a block-level element.

## INLINE ELEMENTS

* An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.

* **span** element is a inline element

# HTML Grouping Tags

* **div** Defines a section in a document (block-level)

* **span** Defines a section in a document (inline)

* The **div** element is usually used as a container for other HTML elements and to separate them for the rest.

* The **div** element is an unstyled tag, in other words, using it does not change the look of an HTML element. Also, it has no required attribute.

* The **span** element can be used as a container for HTML text. 

* But essentially, it is used to style a certain text within a larger text element.

* The **span** element does not automatically style an HTML element. The <span> does notrequire an attribute too!

## Understanding the difference between these two elements allows you to better understand the structure of a web page and how it is displayed.
